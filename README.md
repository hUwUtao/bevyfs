# bevyfs

A filesystem that is intended to use with Bevy the game engine, for the best of compression. There is a reason, because out there, there is not much filesystem for Bevy to choose, and zstd is godtier!

This filesystem took the idea of squashfs, and actually making it feel like home in Rust!
